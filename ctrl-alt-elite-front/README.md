# CosmoLink
CosmoLink is an application that facilitates community building between mentors and mentees and helps to solve lack of connection within the assigned mentor group as well as limited awareness of other mentor groups. The main features of CosmoLink are the BucketList, where mentees can suggest activities to do with their group, and the Leaderboard, which motivates groups to stay engaged in activities through looking at others' scores. Through these features, members of App Dev club's Bootcamp can strength bonds and create a more connected community.
